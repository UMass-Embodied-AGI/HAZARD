## Random agent

* An agent randomly selects low-level actions to execute. To emphasize the hardness of our challenge, we provide more informative actions including walking to the nearest target object (container), picking up (dropping) the nearest object and exploring.
* Code `policy/random.py`
* Usage `--agent_name random`
